# configs

My config files for uhh stuff

## Installing config files

run `./install.sh` while being in the repo directory

## Putting your local config files into the repo

run `./sync.sh` while being in the repo directory

If there are errors while executing `sync.sh` then that's probably because you don't have a certain config on your machine, which is fine
