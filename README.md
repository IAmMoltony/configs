## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAmMoltony/configs ~/configs # clone the repository
cd ~/configs # go into the repo dir
git submodule update --init --recursive # submodules
./install-cascadia-code.sh # install cascadia code (OPTIONAL, don't run if you don't need the font)
./install.sh # install configurations
pip install -r sendemail-requirements.txt # install requirements for sendemail module (*OPTIONAL*, only if you're using HCS)
source ~/.bashrc # reload bashrc
```

### HCS

HCS (Hourly Config Sync, also referred to as Cron Sync) is a convenient system for automatically backing up configs.

See `CronSync.md`.

### Wallpaper changer

The wallpaper changer script changes the wallpaper using `feh`, designed for use in an environment with no DE.

Wallpaper changer requires a file called `/etc/moltony-wallpaper-changer.conf` to be created. The repository provides an example
of the file. Copy it into `/etc` and change to your liking.

#### ok but why do i have to copy it to `/etc`???

So at some point I set up the wallpaper changer as a systemd timer, which do not set the `HOME` variable, so I had to use a fixed
path that does not depend on the user for configuration. Too late (lazy) to change it now.

## Warning

All configs and scripts for installing/updating/syncing assume that this repo is in your home directory, so make sure
you clone it there or symlink it.
